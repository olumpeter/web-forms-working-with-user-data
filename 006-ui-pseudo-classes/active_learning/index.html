    # UI pseudo-classes
    
    ## What pseudo-classes do we have available?

    The original pseudo-classes that are relevant to forms are:

    - `:hover:` Selects an element only when it is being hovered over by a mouse pointer.
    - `:focus:` Selects an element only when it is focused (i.e. by being tabbed to 
    via the keyboard).
    - `:active:` selects an element only when it is being activated (i.e. while it 
    is being clicked on, or when the Return / Enter key is being pressed down in 
    the case of a keyboard activation).

    Other pseudo-classes related to HTML forms are:

    - `:required` and `:optional:` Target elements that can be required 
    (e.g. elements that support the required HTML attribute), based on whether 
    they are required or optional.
    - `:valid` and `:invalid`, and :in-range and :out-of-range: Target form 
    controls that are valid/invalid according to form validation constraints set 
    on them, or in-range/out-of-range.
    - `:enabled` and `:disabled`, and :read-only and :read-write: Target elements 
    that can be disabled (e.g. elements that support the disabled HTML attribute), 
    based on whether they are currently enabled or disabled, and read-write or 
    read-only form controls (e.g. elements with the readonly HTML attribute set).
    - `:checked`, `:indeterminate`, and `:default:` Respectively target checkboxes 
    and radio buttons that are checked, in an indeterminate state (neither 
    checked or not checked), and the default selected option when the page loads
    (e.g. an <input type='checkbox'> with the checked attribute set, or an 
    <option> element with the selected attribute set).

    There are many others, but the ones listed above are the most obviously 
    useful. Some of them are aimed at solving very specific niche problems. The 
    UI pseudo-classes listed above have excellent browser support, but of course, 
    you should test your form implementations carefully to ensure they work for 
    your target audience.

    ## Styling inputs based on whether they are required or not

    One of the most basic concepts regarding client-side form validation is 
    whether a form input is required (it has to be filled in before the form can 
    be submitted) or optional.

    `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` elements have a required attribute 
    available which, when set, means that you have to fill in that control before 
    the form will successfully submit. For example:

    ## Using generated content with pseudo-classes

    The idea is that we can use the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements 
    along with the content property to make a chunk of content appear before or 
    after the affected element. The chunk of content is not added to the DOM, so 
    it may be invisible to some screen readers. Because it is a pseudo-element, 
    it can be targeted with styles in the same way that any actual DOM node can.

    This is really useful when you want to add a visual indicator to an element, 
    such as a label or icon, when alternative indicators are also available to 
    ensure accessibility for all users. For example, in our custom radio buttons example,
    
    ## Styling controls based on whether their data is valid

    The other really important, fundamental concept in form validation is whether 
    a form control's data is valid or not (in the case of numerical data, we can 
    also talk about in-range and out-of-range data). Form controls with constraint 
    limitations can be targeted based on these states.

    ## `:valid` and `:invalid`

    You can target form controls using the `:valid` and `:invalid` pseudo-classes. 
    Some points worth bearing in mind:

    - Controls with no constraint validation will always be valid, and therefore 
    matched with `:valid`.
    - Controls with `required` set on them that have no value are counted as 
    invalid — they will be matched with `:invalid` and `:required`.
    - Controls with built-in validation, such as `<input type='email'>` or 
    `<input type='url'>` are (matched with) `:invalid` when the data entered into 
    them does not match the pattern they are looking for (but they are valid when 
    empty).
    - Controls whose current value is outside the range limits specified by the 
    `min` and `max` attributes are (matched with) `:invalid`, but also matched by 
    `:out-of-range`, as you'll see later on.
    - There are some other ways to make an element matched by `:valid/:invalid`, 
    as you'll see in the Client-side form validation article. But we'll keep 
    things simple for now.

    ## Styling enabled and disabled inputs, and read-only and read-write

    An enabled element is an element that can be activated; it can be selected, 
    clicked on, typed into, etc. A disabled element on the other hand cannot be 
    interacted with in any way, and its data isn't even sent to the server.

    These two states can be targeted using `:enabled` and `:disabled`. Why are 
    disabled inputs useful? Well, sometimes if some data does not apply to a 
    certain user, you might not even want to submit that data when they submit 
    the form. A classic example is a shipping form — commonly you'll get asked 
    if you want to use the same address for billing and shipping; if so, you can 
    just send a single address to the server, and might as well just disable the 
    billing address fields.

    ## Read-only and read-write

    In a similar manner to `:disabled` and `:enabled`, the `:read-only` and 
    `:read-write` pseudo-classes target two states that form inputs toggle 
    between. Read-only inputs have their values submitted to the server, but 
    the user can't edit them, whereas read-write means they can be edited — their 
    default state.

    An input is set to read-only using the `readonly` attribute. As an example, 
    imagine a confirmation page where the developer has sent the details filled 
    in on previous pages over to this page, with the aim of getting the user to 
    check them all in one place, add any final data that is needed, and then 
    confirm the order by submitting. At this point, all the final form data can 
    be sent to the server in one go.

    ## Radio and checkbox states — checked, default, indeterminate

    Radio buttons and checkboxes can be checked or unchecked. But there are a 
    couple of other states to consider too:

    - `:default:` Matches radios/checkboxes that are checked by default, on page 
    load (i.e. by setting the checked attribute on them). These match the 
    `:default` pseudo-class, even if the user unchecks them.
    - `:indeterminate:` When radios/checkboxes are neither checked nor unchecked, 
    they are considered indeterminate and will match the `:indeterminate` 
    pseudo-class. 

    ### `:checked`

    When checked, they will be matched by the `:checked` pseudo-class.

    The most common use of this is to add a different style onto the checkbox or 
    radio button when it is checked, in cases where you've removed the system 
    default styling with `appearance: none;` and want to build the styles back 
    up yourself. We saw examples of this in the previous article when we talked 
    about Using `appearance: none` on radios/checkboxes.

    Basically, we build the styling for a radio button's 'inner circle' using 
    the `::before` pseudo-element, but set a `scale(0)` transform on it. We then 
    use a transition to make the generated content on the label nicely animate 
    into view when the radio is selected/checked. The advantage of using a 
    transform rather than transitioning `width`/`height` is that you can use 
    transform-origin to make it grow from the center of the circle, rather than 
    having it appear to grow from the circle's corner, and there is no jumping 
    behavior as no box model property values are updated.

    ### `:default` and `:indeterminate`

    The `:default` pseudo-class matches radios/checkboxes that are checked by default, 
    on page load, even when unchecked. This could be useful for adding an indicator 
    to a list of options to remind the user what the defaults (or starting options) 
    were, in case they want to reset their choices.

    Also, the radios/checkboxes mentioned above will be matched by the :indeterminate 
    pseudo-class when they are in a state where they are neither checked nor unchecked. 
    But what does this mean? Elements that are indeterminate include:

      - `<input/radio>` inputs, when all radio buttons in a same-named group are unchecked.
      - `<input/checkbox>` inputs whose indeterminate property is set to true via JavaScript
      - `<progress>` elements that have no value.

    This isn't something you'll likely use very often. One use case could be an indicator 
    to tell users that they really need to select a radio button before they move on.

    This provides a little 'Default' label on the item that was originally selected when 
    the page loaded. Note here we are using the subsequent-sibling combinator (~) rather 
    than the Next-sibling combinator (+) — we need to do this because the <span> does 
    not come right after the <input> in the source order.

    For the `:indeterminate` example, we've got no default selected radio button — this 
    is important — if there was, then there would be no indeterminate state to style. 

    ## More pseudo-classes

    There are a number of other pseudo-classes of interest, and we don't have space to 
    write about them all in detail here. Let's talk about a few more that you should 
    take the time to investigate.

    - The `:focus-within` pseudo-class matches an element that has received focus 
    or contains an element that has received focus. This is useful if you want 
    a whole form to highlight in some way when an input inside it is focused.
    - The `:focus-visible` pseudo-class matches focused elements that received 
    focus via keyboard interaction (rather than touch or mouse) — useful if you 
    want to show a different style for keyboard focus compared to mouse (or other) focus.
    - The `:placeholder-shown` pseudo-class matches `<input>` and <textarea> elements that 
    have their placeholder showing (i.e. the contents of the placeholder attribute) because 
    the value of the element is empty.

    ## Summary

    This completes our look at UI pseudo-classes that relate to form inputs. Keep playing 
    with them, and create some fun form styles! Next up, we'll move on to something 
    different — client-side form validation.
