    # The HTML5 input types

    ## Email address field

    This type of field is set using the value `email` for the `type` attribute.

    ## Search field

    Search fields are intended to be used to create search boxes on pages and 
    apps. This type of field is set by using the value search for the `type` 
    attribute.

    The main difference between a `text` field and a `search` field is how the 
    browser styles its appearance. Often, search fields are rendered with 
    rounded corners; they also sometimes display an 'Ⓧ', which clears the 
    field of any value when clicked. Additionally, on devices with dynamic 
    keyboards, the keyboard's enter key may read 'search', or display a 
    magnifying glass icon.

    Another worth-noting feature is that the values of a search field can be 
    automatically saved and re-used to offer auto-completion across multiple 
    pages of the same website; this tends to happen automatically in most modern 
    browsers.

    ## Phone number field

    A special field for filling in phone numbers can be created using `tel` as 
    the value of the type attribute.

    Due to the wide variety of phone number formats around the world, this type 
    of field does not enforce any constraints on the value entered by a user 
    (this means it may include letters, etc.).

    ## URL field

    A special type of field for entering URLs can be created using the value 
    `url` for the `type` attribute.

    It adds special validation constraints to the field. The browser will report 
    an error if no protocol (such as http:) is entered, or if the URL is otherwise 
    malformed. On devices with dynamic keyboards, the default keyboard will often 
    display some or all of the colon, period, and forward slash as default keys.

    ## Numeric field

    Controls for entering numbers can be created with an `<input>` `type` of 
    `number`. This control looks like a text field but allows only floating-point 
    numbers, and usually provides buttons in the form of a spinner to increase 
    and decrease the value of the control. On devices with dynamic keyboards, the 
    numeric keyboard is generally displayed.

    With the `number` input type, you can constrain the minimum and maximum 
    values allowed by setting the `min` and `max` attributes.

    You can also use the step attribute to set the increment increase and 
    decrease caused by pressing the spinner buttons. By default, the number 
    input type only validates if the number is an integer. To allow float numbers, 
    specify step='any'. If omitted, the step value defaults to 1, meaning only 
    whole numbers are valid.

    ## Slider controls

    Another way to pick a number is to use a **slider**. You see these quite often 
    on sites like house-buying sites where you want to set a maximum property 
    price to filter by.

    One problem with sliders is that they don't offer any kind of visual 
    feedback as to what the current value is. This is why we've included an 
    `<output>` element to contain the current value. You could display an input 
    value or the output of a calculation inside any element, but `<output>` is 
    special — like `<label>` — and it can take a for attribute that allows you to 
    associate it with the element or elements that the output value came from.

    To actually display the current value, and update it as it changed, you must 
    use JavaScript, but this is relatively easy to do.

    ## Date and time pickers

    Gathering date and time values has traditionally been a nightmare for web 
    developers. For a good user experience, it is important to provide a calendar 
    selection UI, enabling users to select dates without necessitating context 
    switching to a native calendar application or potentially entering them in 
    differing formats that are hard to parse. The last minute of the previous 
    millennium can be expressed in the following different ways, for example: 
    1999/12/31, 23:59 or 12/31/99T11:59PM.

    HTML date controls are available to handle this specific kind of data, 
    providing calendar widgets and making the data uniform.

    A date and time control is created using the `<input>` element and an 
    appropriate value for the `type` attribute, depending on whether you wish to 
    collect dates, times, or both.

    ### datetime-local

    `<input type='datetime-local'>` creates a widget to display and pick a date 
    with time with no specific time zone information.

    ## Color picker control

    Colors are always a bit difficult to handle. There are many ways to express 
    them: RGB values (decimal or hexadecimal), HSL values, keywords, and so on.

    A `color` control can be created using the `<input>` element with its `type` 
    attribute set to the value `color`.

    Clicking a color control generally displays the operating system's default 
    color-picking functionality for you to choose.

    The value returned is always a lowercase 6-value hexadecimal color.

    ## Summary

    That brings us to the end of our tour of the HTML5 form input types. There 
    are a few other control types that cannot be easily grouped together due to 
    their very specific behaviors, but which are still essential to know about. We 
    cover those in the next article.
