    ## What are web forms?

    **Web forms** are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a 
    website or application. Forms allow users to enter data, which is generally 
    sent to a web server for processing and storage, or used on the client-side 
    to immediately update the interface in some way (for example, add another 
    item to a list, or show or hide a UI feature).

    A web form's HTML is made up of one or more **form controls** (sometimes called 
    **widgets**), plus some additional elements to help structure the overall form — 
    they are often referred to as **HTML forms**. The controls can be single or 
    multi-line text fields, dropdown boxes, buttons, checkboxes, or radio 
    buttons, and are mostly created using the &lt;input&gt; element, although 
    there are some other elements to learn about too.

    Form controls can also be programmed to enforce specific formats or values to 
    be entered (form validation), and paired with text labels that describe their 
    purpose to both sighted and visually impaired users.

    ## Designing your form

    Before starting to code, it's always better to step back and take the time to 
    think about your form. Designing a quick mockup will help you to define the 
    right set of data you want to ask your user to enter. From a user experience 
    (UX) point of view, it's important to remember that the bigger your form, the 
    more you risk frustrating people and losing users. Keep it simple and stay 
    focused: ask only for the data you absolutely need.

    Designing forms is an important step when you are building a site or 
    application. 

    In this article, we'll build a simple contact form. Let's make a rough sketch.

    ```Contact 
    Name: Text field
    E-mail: Text field
    Message: Text field
    SEND YOUR MESSAGE - Button
    ```

    Our form will contain three text fields and one button. We are asking the user 
    for their name, their email and the message they want to send. Hitting the 
    button will send their data to a web server.

    ## Active learning: Implementing our form HTML

    Ok, let's have a go at creating the HTML for our form. We will use the 
    following HTML elements: &lt;form&gt;, &lt;label&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, &gt;textarea&gt;, 
    and &lt;button&gt;.

    Before you go any further, make a local copy of our simple HTML template — 
    you'll enter your form HTML into here.

    ## The &lt;form&gt; element

    All forms start with a &lt;form&gt; element, like this:

    ```html
    <form action='/my-handling-form-page' method='post'>
      ...
    </form>
    ```

    This element formally defines a form. It's a container element like a 
    &lt;section&gt; or &lt;footer&gt; element, but specifically for containing 
    forms; it also supports some specific attributes to configure the way the 
    form behaves. All of its attributes are optional, but it's standard practice 
    to always set at least the action and method attributes:

    - The `action` attribute defines the location (URL) where the form's 
    collected data should be sent when it is submitted.
    - The `method` attribute defines which HTTP method to send the data with 
    (usually `get` or `post`).

    For now, add the above &lt;form&gt; element into your HTML &lt;body&gt;.

    ### The &lt;label&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, and &lt;textarea&gt; elements

    Our contact form is not complex: the data entry portion contains three text 
    fields, each with a corresponding &lt;label&gt;:

      - The input field for the name is a single-line text field.
      - The input field for the email is an input of type email: a single-line 
      text field that accepts only email addresses.
      - The input field for the message is a `&lt;textarea&gt;;` a multiline text 
      field.
    
    The `&lt;li&gt;` elements are there to conveniently structure our code and make 
    styling easier. For usability and accessibility, we include an explicit label 
    for each form control. Note the use of the for attribute on all `&lt;label&gt;` 
    elements, which takes as its value the id of the form control with which it 
    is associated — this is how you associate a form control with its label.

    There is great benefit to doing this — it associates the label with the form 
    control, enabling mouse, trackpad, and touch device users to click on the 
    label to activate the corresponding control, and it also provides an accessible 
    name for screen readers to read out to their users.

    On the `&lt;input&gt;` element, the most important attribute is the `type` 
    attribute. This attribute is extremely important because it defines the way 
    the &lt;input&gt; element appears and behaves.

    - In our simple example, we use the value `text` for the first input — the 
    default value for this attribute. It represents a basic single-line text field 
    that accepts any kind of text input.
    - For the second input, we use the value email, which defines a single-line 
    text field that only accepts a well-formed email address. 
    - This turns a basic text field into a kind of &quot;intelligent&quot; field 
    that will perform some validation checks on the data typed by the user. It 
    also causes a more appropriate keyboard layout for entering email addresses 
    (e.g. with an @ symbol by default) to appear on devices with dynamic 
    keyboards, like smartphones.
    
    Last but not least, note the syntax of `&lt;input&gt;` vs. `&lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;`. 
    This is one of the oddities of HTML. The `&lt;input&gt;` tag is a void element, 
    meaning that it doesn't need a closing tag. `&lt;textarea&gt;` is not a void 
    element, meaning it should be closed with the proper ending tag. This has an 
    impact on a specific feature of forms: the way you define the default value. 
    To define the default value of an `&lt;input&gt;` element you have to use the 
    value attribute like this:

    ```html
    <input type='text' value='by default this element is filled with this text' />
    ```

    On the other hand, if you want to define a default value for a `&lt;textarea&gt;`, 
    you put it between the opening and closing tags of the `&lt;textarea&gt;` 
    element, like this:

    ```html
    <textarea>
      by default this element is filled with this text
    </textarea>
    ```

    ### The `&lt;button&gt;` element

    The markup for our form is almost complete; we just need to add a button to 
    allow the user to send, or 'submit', their data once they have filled out the 
    form. This is done by using the &lt;button&gt; element.

    The &gt;button&lt; element also accepts a type attribute — this accepts one 
    of three values: `submit`, `reset`, or `button`.

    - A click on a `submit` button (the default value) sends the form's data to 
    the web page defined by the action attribute of the &lt;form&gt; element.
    - A click on a `reset` button resets all the form widgets to their default 
    value immediately. From a UX point of view, this is considered bad practice, 
    so you should avoid using this type of button unless you really have a good 
    reason to include one.
    - A click on a `button` button does nothing! That sounds silly, but it's 
    amazingly useful for building custom buttons — you can define their chosen 
    functionality with JavaScript.


   >** Note**: You can also use the `&lt;input&gt;` element with the corresponding 
   type to produce a button, for example `&lt;input type='submit'&gt;`. The main 
   advantage of the &lt;button&gt; element is that the `&lt;input&gt;` element 
   only allows plain text in its label whereas the &lt;button&gt; element allows 
   full HTML content, allowing more complex, creative button content.

   ## Basic form styling

   Now that you have finished writing your form's HTML code, try saving it and 
   looking at it in a browser. At the moment, you'll see that it looks rather ugly.

   Forms are notoriously tricky to style nicely. It is beyond the scope of this 
   article to teach you form styling in detail, so for the moment we will just 
   get you to add some CSS to make it look OK.

   ## Sending form data to your web server

   The last part, and perhaps the trickiest, is to handle form data on the server 
   side. The `&lt;form&gt;` element defines where and how to send the data thanks 
   to the `action` and `method` attributes.

   We provide a `name` attribute for each form control. The names are important 
   on both the client- and server-side; they tell the browser which name to give 
   each piece of data and, on the server side, they let the server handle each 
   piece of data by name. The form data is sent to the server as name/value pairs.

   To name the data in a form, you need to use the `name` attribute on each form 
   widget that will collect a specific piece of data.

   In our example, the form will send 3 pieces of data named `'user_name'`, 
   `'user_email'`, and `'user_message'`. That data will be sent to the URL 
   `'/my-handling-form-page'` using the HTTP `POST` method.

   On the server side, the script at the URL `'/my-handling-form-page'` will receive 
   the data as a list of 3 key/value items contained in the HTTP request. The way 
   this script will handle that data is up to you. Each server-side language 
   (PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, C#, etc.) has its own mechanism of handling form 
   data. It's beyond the scope of this guide to go deeply into that subject, but 
   if you want to know more, we have provided some examples in our 
   [Sending form data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data) 
   article later on.

   ## Summary

   Congratulations, you've built your first web form.
   That's only the beginning, however — now it's time to take a deeper look. 
   Forms have way more power than what we saw here and the other articles in this 
   module will help you to master the rest.
